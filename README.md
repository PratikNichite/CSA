### Climate Stability Analysis for Agricultural Investment Decisions

**context:** An agricultural investment firm is in the process of deciding on a location for a new farming project. Understanding that **consistent** and predictable weather conditions are vital for successful agriculture, the firm aims to evaluate and compare two potential cities based on their temperature stability. The key factor in this decision-making process is the variability in average daily temperatures, as it directly impacts crop growth and agricultural planning.

The firm has provided a dataset, named **"climate_data.csv"**, to aid in this assessment. This dataset includes the following columns:

- **month:** Indicates the month of the year.
- **Avg Temp City A (°C):** The average daily temperature for City A in each month, measured in degrees Celsius.
- **Avg Temp City B (°C):** The average daily temperature for City B in each month, measured in degrees Celsius.


### Task Objective

- Calculate the standard deviation for average temperatures in both cities.
- Determine which city has a higher temperature variability.
- Decide on the city with more stable (lower variability) temperatures for agricultural investment.
